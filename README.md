# atlasparts
Inventory tracking at Atlas.

This project is a learning experience for me and is very much a work in progress.


## Languages/frameworks used:
- Python 3.5 - By no means is Python my main language coming from an embedded electronics background.
- Django 3.0 - is even further away from my knowledge.
bulma.css - CSS framework, even though I hate flat looking frameworks. This seemed the smallest css framework (in size - I hate things being slow and reliant on others) with the most consistent look across desktop/mobile & tablet.


## Background
The aim is to develop a system whereby parts can tracked throughout the company.

Mainly to do with serialised items.

The company is a manufacturing facility.

The product it manufactures is configured per market per customer.

Major components inside the product all have unique serial numbers. With the product having a unique number as well. Again, the requirements of this unique number are jurisdictional based. What this means in real terms is that there is no uniform serial number per product.

Major parts serial numbers can all be traced back to the OEM and invoice/delivery etc.

As the manufacturing facility starts to create pre-build products, parts often change just prior to shipping to the customer. This is often done outside of the main factory, e.g. at interstate or overseas warehouses.

This movement of individual parts is often lost in the current inventory system and every machine must be tracked for regulatory requirements.


## Reason for open source
I am opening up the source code as I feel I might be able to provide others with a starting point of a real world project.
As this is my first steps in to web development, after 25 years in the embedded market, where C rules the world, I will make mistakes (Big and small, hopefully only once :blush:).

:warning: Use the code at your own risk. I am no expert, just trying to solve a problem.
